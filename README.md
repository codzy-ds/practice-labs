# practice-labs

Practice lab is a small application to manage the actual practice before a certification exam. Created for the CKAD, 
the idea is to add more questions for more exams to be able to understand the subject pratically, not only theorically.


## The problem

When studying for a certifications, most of the time there is books and theoric practice exams. When studying for a more hands-on exam, you have to have a lot of truc.
